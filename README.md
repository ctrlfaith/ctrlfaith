## 👨‍💻 About Me  

I'm a 4th-year IT student who enjoys learning and building web applications.  

I'm interested in how the **development** and **testing** sides can work together  
to improve software quality — both in terms of reliability and maintainability.  

Right now, I'm working on various projects to practice my skills in **Laravel**, **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **RESTful APIs**,  
while also learning more about **Software Testing** and **API Integration**.  

My main tech stack includes **Laravel**, **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, **MySQL**, and **Postman**,  
which reflects my focus on **full-stack web development** and my understanding of software quality.  

🌱 **Currently learning:** Laravel, Next.js, Tailwind CSS  
🔍 **Especially interested in:** Web Development, RESTful APIs, Software Testing  
⚙️ **I like:** coding, solving problems, and understanding how things work under the hood  
🧩 **Goal:** to become a full-stack developer who values both functionality and quality
